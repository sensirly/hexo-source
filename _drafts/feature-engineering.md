## Feature Extraction 


## Feature Construction
- One-Hot Encoding
- FM 
- GBDT

## Feature Importance
- Correlation Coefficient or AUC of the feature and label
- Linear model: absolute weight of each feature
- Random Forest/GBDT: number of split time

## Feature Selection
- Remove Collinearity：Examine the correlation coefficient for each pair of independent variables. A value of the correlation near ±1 indicates that the two variables are highly correlated.
- Remove Redundant: low Feature Importance

## Feature Learning
numerical, categorical feature
